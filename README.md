# Personalized-Study-Resource-Tracker
Personalized Study Resource Tracker is a web application designed to help students organize study materials in one place. Users can create boards for subjects or topics, add external links (YouTube, Drive, articles), categorize resources by type, and track progress using simple status levels like To-Do, In-Progress, and Completed.
